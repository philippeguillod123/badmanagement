A real example when a Manager Becomes a Risk: How Certain Leadership Patterns Quietly Destroy Teams
There is a persistent myth in organizations that any technically competent or commercially successful individual can be trusted with people management. In reality, leadership is not neutral. When exercised poorly, it becomes a risk one that compounds over time and harms individuals, teams, and the organization itself.

This article examines a specific and unfortunately common leadership profile: a manager whose behavior consistently undermines psychological safety, distorts accountability, and creates an environment where performance deteriorates not despite leadership, but because of it.

This is not a story about intent, personality, or isolated incidents. It is about patterns and why some individuals should not be entrusted with managing people.
